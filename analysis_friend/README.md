## Outputs
This progam is capable of outputing cross sections for double charged pion electroproduction off the proton for CLAS data, specifically data sets e1-6 and e1f. These include both single differential cross section as well as polarization observables. Further, a W/Q^{2} 
## Inputs
There are several different ways to run this program. The way it is intended for complete cross sections
